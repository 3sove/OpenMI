The GUI (Config Editor)
=======================
This development is deprecated in favour of a parallel development on the Fluid Earth Pipistrelle. Pipistrelle will become the OpenMI association preferred UI.

The OATC GUI is retained as it is usful for OATC (and others) to simply develop ideas for future OpenMI proposals. However, if you just wish to use a UI you should use Pipistrelle, refer to OpenMI association web pages for details on Pipistrelle download.
